Assignment Day 3

Q1.Sum of 'n' numbers using While Loop:

Code:

a= eval(input("Enter the Number"))

if a < 0:
    print("Enter a positive number")
else:
    sum = 0
   # use while loop to iterate until zero
while(a > 0):
    sum += a
    a -= 1
print("The sum is", sum)



Entered Number is 10 which is positive


Output:

The sum is 55.

Q2. Enter a number and check if it is prime or not?

Code:

# Program to check if a number is prime or not

# prime numbers are greater than 1

num=eval(input("Enter a Number"))

if num > 1:
   # check for factors
   for i in range(2,num):
    if (num % i) == 0:
           print(num,"is not a prime number")
           break
   else:
       print(num,"is a prime number")
       
# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
   print(num,"is not a prime number")






  Output:

Entered Number is:9

9 is not a prime number

Entered Number is 3

3 is a prime number



Entered Number is:




Output:
