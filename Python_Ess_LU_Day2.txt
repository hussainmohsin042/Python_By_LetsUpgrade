# Assignment of Day-02



1 . BASIC PYTHON SYNTAX :

Back slash
Triple quotes
String inside the quotes
Escape sequence of string
Formatted output.
2 . PYTHON VARIABLE : 

Variable means linking of the data to a name.
Variable refers to the memory location that contains the data.
        For example ,a=10. 

RULES :

Variable cannot start with number. 
            Example , 10a (x)

 Variable can lower or upper case, numbers, underscore.   
             Example , a=10, A=10, -=30

3.PYTHON OPERATORS :

a ) Arithmetic operators

   **, *, /, %, +, -, //

b) Comparision  operators

    ==, <, >, <=, >=, !=

c) Assignment operators 

    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, **=

d) Bitwise operators

   |, &, ~, ^, <<, >> 

e) Logical operators

   AND, OR, NOT

f) Membership operators

    in, not in

g) Identity operators

    is, is not

h) operator precedence 

  :=,lambda, if -else, or, and, not

1.Variables: Syntax: Variable Name = value

number = 1947

2.Operators and Assignment Operation and also Formatted Strings

operand1 = 25
operand2 = 5
operation = 0

3.Addition
operation = operand1 + operand2
print(f"Addition Value = {operation} \n") #Escape Sequences

4.Subtraction
operation = operand1 - operand2
print(f"Subtracted Value = {operation}")

5.Division
operation = operand1//operand2 #Returns Integer
print(f"Divided Value = {operation}")

6.Reminder
operation = operand1 % operand2
print(f'Reminder\'s = {operation}') #Back Slash
#Multipliaction
operation = operand1 * operand2
print(f"Multiplied Value = {operation}")

7.Triple Quotes
